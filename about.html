      <p style="color: black"> I am a bubbly and smiley girl whose main activity is to laugh all the time. School was not important to me until I started my technological studies at high school: STI2D. This was a revelation. I loved learning in different technical fields: mechanics, electricity, energy, information etc... which led me directly to the engineering profession. For that I went to the CPGE TSI over 2 years to prepare myself for the competitive exams of the grandes écoles of engineering. After learning a lot about mathematics and physics applied to engineering sciences, I decided to enter the world of work by choosing a school of engineering in apprenticeship in mechatronics allowing me to remain a generalist while evolving in the world of robotics and embedded systems. I worked during these 3 years of school in a company dealing with the maintenance of a nuclear waste treatment plant. My apprenticeship was based on methods engineering and new works. The areas of work were mainly mechanical, hydraulic and electrical. Afterwards, having graduated, I wanted to go and discover a new country and move to another part of mechatronics: embedded systems and programming. 
      I love multidisciplinarity. This is what drives me and what I like about mechatronics. You can see this in my CV. I am not afraid to go to new horizons because I know that my way of working and my perseverance will allow me to quickly fill the gaps. 
      Later, after an apprenticeship in totally different fields, I see myself as a multidisciplinary project manager able to guide the people in my team in their respective fields.
